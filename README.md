Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents?select=US_Accidents_March23.csv
The dataset worked on is not pushed into the repository as the data is of 3.2GB and github gives free storage of 100MB and lfs of total 1.0GB.
I request you to download the file from the link mentioned and extract into the directory where the analysis files are downloaded.
Please run the jupyter notebook once, then a new cleaned dataset will be added into the directory. If tableau doesn't visualize the visualizations directly, pls connect to the cleaned dataset which was made after running the notebook file.
